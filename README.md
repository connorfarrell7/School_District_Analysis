# School District Analysis

## Overview
Maria is doing an analysis of a school district, and she has asked for my help. Due to the possibility of dishonesty from one of the schools, the dataset must be altered to omit ninth graders from Thomas High School. She is looking for someone that can work with the Panda’s Library to create tables for her to visualize her data. Using Python and Pandas, I am going to provide her with the requested sets of information in an easy-to-understand format.

### Results
-	The district summary is hardly changed, with less than one percent difference with the new dataset.
